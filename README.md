# What is this project?

The goal of this git repo is to host a GitHub page discussing a flexible study plan in philosophy. You can find the website [here](https://kuri7.github.io/A-Study-Plan-in-Philosophy/).

# Can I contribute?

Absolutely! Recommendations (especially for non-western philosophy) are more than welcome! Don't hesitate to send me a message on GitHub or to make a pull request to discuss or suggest a change to the study plan.
