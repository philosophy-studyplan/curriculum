# Summary

The goal of this page is to create a flexible and modern syllabus in philosophy in the spirit of [this great resource](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). The goal will be to organize the website in a similar fashion, using references to free courses whenever I can. I do not claim to know philosophy perfectly well, so any comment or suggestion is more than welcome.

# Introductory Classes
### Introduction to Philosophy
The purpose of this section is to get you acquainted with philosophy. You should run both classes simultaneously as they will complement each other. The first one is an introduction to some essential themes in philosophy, and the second one covers logic, fallacies and what constitutes a good argument. Philosophy is not a spectator's sport however, and you have to go construct arguments yourself at some point. For this purpose, it is crucial that you do the [assignments](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-00-problems-of-philosophy-fall-2019/assignments/) on the [class homepage at MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-00-problems-of-philosophy-fall-2019/index.htm). Take your time to digest the assigned [readings](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-00-problems-of-philosophy-fall-2019/readings/), at least those that you can access freely.
