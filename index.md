# Summary

The goal of this page is to create a flexible and modern syllabus in philosophy in the spirit of https://github.com/ossu/computer-science. The goal will be to organize the website in a similar fashion, using references to free courses whenever I can. I do not claim to know philosophy perfectly well, so any comment or suggestion is more than welcome.
