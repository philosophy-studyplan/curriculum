# Summary

The goal of this page is to create a flexible study plan in philosophy (mostly Western since this is what I know, although suggestions are more than open!) in the spirit of [this great resource](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). The goal will be to organize the study plan in a similar fashion, using references to free courses whenever I can. I do not claim to know philosophy perfectly well, so any comment or suggestion is more than welcome. For most classes, I will try my best to give a resource that is free for everyone to watch and/or read, but reading a lot is crucial to one's development in philosophy. As such, most classes will have a reading component, an assignment component and (hopefully) video lectures or lecture notes of some sort.

**How to follow this study plan:** I highly suggest you go through the introductory classes and the core courses in a linear fashion. Sometimes, classes have to be taken at the same time and I will always explicitly say that in the short write-up before the classes in question. Sometimes, I will provide two classes for one specific topic. It is up to you whether you want to do both or not. I suggest mixing and matching. For instance, if one class has video lectures but no assignments and no readings, but the other does, then watch the lectures as you read and go through the assignments. Usually, the first link in a class table is required, but I will sometimes add another (or multiple) other links that would be interesting to watch but are not necessarily required reading. Some courses can overlap.

**Duration:** A key thing to keep in mind is that the duration and effort per week estimates are only that, estimates. It is extremely hard to estimate properly how much time it will take you to read a text, analyze it, understand it and digest it well enough to explain the core arguments in an essay. As such, I will use the duration/effort periods when they are given by the instructors themselves, and there will be an asterisk when the duration/effort number is a pure guess.

**I disagree with what is considered core**: That is totally fair. I think it's hard to say what is a "core sequence" in philosophy, because it's very wide in scope and everyone has different interests. If something doesn't interest you, no one's judging you. The core sequence simply represents classes that I think are important to an undergraduate education in philosophy.

**What about books? Will you include X's book on Y?**: The short answer is no unless it's already required reading in a class. I'm looking for actual courses, with assignments and specific reading. This also excludes very popular books like Kant's Critique of Pure Reason or Plato's Republic (say). The reason why is that this is usually too difficult for a beginner in philosophy. Jumping straight into [Aristotle's massive Collected Works](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Aristotle-Vol-1/dp/069101650X/) can be tough because you need to learn a specific vocabulary and way of thinking that requires time and effort to develop. 

That is not to say there is no point in reading from the source directly. Actually, I advise you to look into various philosophers you enjoyed reading about and look at their work, either directly or with a secondary source. But I want to make sure the classes have additional information on helping you wade through the books, either in the form of video lectures or lecture notes, or more simply with specified readings with assignments that make sure you're challenging what you're reading and you're taking time to really assimilate the various arguments the author is making.

## Introductory Classes
### Introduction to Philosophy
The purpose of this section is to get you acquainted with philosophy. You should run both classes simultaneously as they will complement each other. The first one is an introduction to some essential themes in philosophy, and the second one covers logic, fallacies and what constitutes a good argument. Philosophy is not a spectator's sport however, and you have to construct arguments yourself at some point. The logic class will help with that. Lastly, the third class is an alternative version of the first one, with less breadth but more depth. **Before you start**, I highly suggest reading [this](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/reading.html) and [this](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html).

## Core Sequence
This section will deal with common topics that a wide range of philosophy undergraduate students will encounter at some point. Sometimes, only an introduction to the topic will be given, but a more advanced class can be taken in the electives section.

### Historical Philosophy

This class will introduce you to a few important Western philosophers. You will read about various arguments these philosophers have put forth in multiple fields of philosphy and how they interact. It is **imperative** that you go through the assignments and exams. The class has a complete set of lecture notes but I would advise you to get the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Classics-Philosophy-Louis-P-Pojman/dp/0199737290/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Classics+of+Philosophy&qid=1629197044&sr=8-1) recommended. The class is based on the second edition of this book so it might be useful to compare the differences with the third which is the commonly available one.

### Ethics

Ethics concerns our notions of right and wrong. The goal of this section is to think about difficult ethical questions and how to tackle them rigorously. The first course has a [homepage at OCW MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-02-moral-problems-and-the-good-life-fall-2008/) with assignments, additional readings and more. The second course is an interesting exploration into practical questions that concerns us to this day, ranging from poverty to environmental issues such as sustainable development. Various religious views on virtue are explored as well.

[Ethics in Action](https://www.edx.org/course/ethics-in-action) | 10 weeks | 2-4h/week | none

### Epistemology

Epistemology is the study of knowledge in its various forms. What can we know? What is knowledge? The following class has readings and assignments but no lecture notes sadly.

### Metaphysics

Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that studies the first principles of being, identity and change, space and time, causality, necessity and possibility. The first class will tackle various topics such as ontology, time and free will to name a few. It has readings and various assignments but no lecture notes. The second one is an alternative class focusing mainly on the concept of free will, but with lecture notes.

### Philosophy of Mind

The Philosophy of Mind is a branch of philosophy that is concerned with the mind and its relationship to the body. Consciousness is another important topic in this field. The class has an associated [MIT homepage](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-09-minds-and-machines-fall-2011/) that you should visit as well.

### Political Philosophy

Political philosophy is concerned with the nature, scope, and legitimacy of public agents and institutions and the relationships between them. It discusses topics such as freedom, government, laws and authority. The first class is a general introduction to the concept of justice, while the second one focuses on the philosophy of law in particular.

## Elective Classes

This section discusses undergraduate elective classes. The topics are either follow-ups of previous classes (such as ethics or logic) or completely separate topics. Classes should now be chosen primarily on the basis of interest. There is no linear ordering here, you can pick and choose sections as you see fit as long as the requirements are cleared.

### Ancient Philosophy

This course will discuss ancient philosophy in more details, focusing mainly on Plato and Aristotle, although Epicurus and Lucretius are also mentioned at the end. The topics tackled are varied this course is a great follow-up to [Classics in Western Philosophy](#classics-in-western-philosophy) for those that appreciated the earlier part of the course.

### Logic

Expanding on the first logic class in [Introductory Classes](#introductory-classes), the first sequence will explore more advanced topics in logic from meta-theory to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem. The other course focuses on modal logic. Another good resource on logic that could help you while going through is [this book](https://forallx.openlogicproject.org/forallxyyc.pdf).
